# FBLA-Computer-Game-and-Simulation
The game is a hack and slash that tests users on topics related to FBLA and have fun while at it. The game consists of different level, each having their own topic. The player will have to clear the room of enemies before the questions display. For the boss level they will be asked questions when they get close to the boss. The player has health that will be lost if taken damage by the enemies and when they answer questions, they must get half of the questions correct (3 out of 6 or 2 out of 4). If they get half wrong they die and have to restart. Also, they are timed for answering questions because every second that passes by reduces player health.
